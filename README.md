# INSTAGRAM-USER-ANALYTICS

### Project Overview

This Project helps to analyze the raw data to create useful insights for marketing, product and development teams in order to assist them with generating business insight . During this process, I am using various SQL
queries to collect the required data. My analysis of the provided data enabled me to identify the oldest users, the most popular hashtag etc.

### Project Approach:

In order to execute the project , **MySQL** was used to create a database using the raw data provided . Once the database was created , various sorting and data extracting queries were used to get the insights required.

### Tech Stack Used:

MySQL Workbench v8.0.32.0 was used during project execution in order to query the database. The ease of access and setup, troubleshooting support as well as the GUI made it a good tool for the project.

### Project Insights :

The knowledge that I gained from this project is how to create the database ,how to use the database , how can we perform SQL operation based on scenarios and how we can use this data to improve the experience altogether while helping this business grow.
